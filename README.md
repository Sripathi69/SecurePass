✅ v1.0.0 – Usage

Download using the link below and copy to your final folder. If Windows Defender gives any message click continue.

In the first run, the software creates local secure encrypted files. In case you want to move the software to another location, 

ensure that you move the entire folder structure including the files. If you do not do that, or miss files when moving, software will assume that you 

are starting fresh and old password data will be lost. It may also fail citing corrupt data. 

You can however use the software in a new folder and it creates required encryption files once again. 


✅ Advanced version:

This software is for personal use and has MIT license. An enterprise level secure version is in the works and will be released later this year.
